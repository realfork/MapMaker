# Map Maker

Creates maps of the area around you!

Usage: /mapper <radius>

Only works with 16x texture packs. You can edit it to use other resolutions with relative ease.

There are a few bad workarounds because of bufferedimage but the code is mostly fine?

If you use a lot of code from this please credit me, but don't worry if you are only borrowing a couple lines :)
Enjoy! 

Example:
![Example Map (1024x1024 blocks)](./Maps/Map-Example.png)
